# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to apply my newly learned CSS and HTML skills (especially using flex-box) to make a professional portfolio website with my current acheivements. It helped me learn to implement all I've been learning in one place and work on my problem solving skills when things went wrong or unexpected. I also learned that it takes a lot of checking back on what changes my code made to the live site and adjusting it where i saw fit.

## Installation/Usage

There is no need to install my project as it is just a webpage but to access it simply look under the deployments tab and click on my github page. This is a screenshot of what the page should look like upon accessing.
